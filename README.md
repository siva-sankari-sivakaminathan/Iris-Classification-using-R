This project implements machine learning algorithms in R to classify Iris flowers into their respective species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

Key Findings:

Compared five classification models: LDA, CART, KNN, SVM, and Random Forest.

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 0.9833 and Kappa of 0.975.

This project explores:

Model selection and evaluation techniques for classification tasks.

The effectiveness of LDA for datasets with well-defined class separation.

Further Exploration:

Visualize the decision boundary of the LDA model.
Evaluate model performance on unseen Iris flower data.
Analyze feature importance to understand the most influential measurements for classification.
